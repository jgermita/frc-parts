## about this project
This project is an extension the work that many FIRST teams do every year: document the common parts that they order. This project dates back to 2012 when I created a spreadsheet to keep track of the various parts we used for FRC and FTC robots. The goal of the project has since expanded to documenting the neat and nifty parts that leave us asking questions like "What was that part that team ABCD used on their 20XX robot?" 

This project aims to centralize the answers to these questions and more. 

## usage notes
Many products listed can be sourced from multiple vendors, or even local vendors. For the sake of simplicity, one vendor is listed. Part legality on FIRST robots is not guaranteed nor implied. Please refer to the current year's game manual and Q&A for final ruling. Products listed and team associations do not represent official endorsements by any team.
